# 33JsConcepts

Is actually a nice and lovely [Repo](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) from [Leonardo Maldonado](https://github.com/leonardomso).

I loved it thats why i suggested building a nice and minimal website for it.

After this [discussion](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts/issues/170#issuecomment-1736768297) i decided to finally start with the project.
